# Behaviorial Cloning Project

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

## Overview

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator (the vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track)
* Summarize the results with a written report

The following resources can be found in this github repository:
* [__model.py__](https://github.com/gtesei/SelfDrivingCars/blob/master/P3-CarND-Behavioral-Cloning/model.py) containing the script to create and train the model
* [__drive.py__](https://github.com/gtesei/SelfDrivingCars/blob/master/P3-CarND-Behavioral-Cloning/video.py) for driving the car in autonomous mode
* __model.h5__ containing a trained convolution neural network 
* [__writeup_report.md__](https://github.com/gtesei/SelfDrivingCars/blob/master/P3-CarND-Behavioral-Cloning/writeup_report.md) summarizing the results
* __video.mp4__ containing the video showing that the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road (see on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/lzqxdYs-e4Y))

## Details About Files In This Directory

### `drive.py`

Usage of `drive.py` requires you have saved the trained model as an h5 file, i.e. `model.h5`. See the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model) for how to create this file using the following command:
```sh
model.save(filepath)
```

Once the model has been saved, it can be used with drive.py using this command:

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.

Note: There is known local system's setting issue with replacing "," with "." when using drive.py. When this happens it can make predicted steering values clipped to max/min values. If this occurs, a known fix for this is to add "export LANG=en_US.utf8" to the bashrc file.

#### Saving a video of the autonomous agent

```sh
python drive.py model.h5 run1
```

The fourth argument, `run1`, is the directory in which to save the images seen by the agent. If the directory already exists, it'll be overwritten.

```sh
ls run1

The image file name is a timestamp of when the image was seen. This information is used by `video.py` to create a chronological video of the agent driving.

### `video.py`

```sh
python video.py run1
```

Creates a video based on images found in the `run1` directory. The name of the video will be the name of the directory followed by `'.mp4'`, so, in this case the video will be `run1.mp4`.

Optionally, one can specify the FPS (frames per second) of the video:

```sh
python video.py run1 --fps 48
```

Will run the video at 48 FPS. The default FPS is 60.
